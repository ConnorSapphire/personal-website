# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
If you want the subscribe form to work, you need to setup a .env file in the
parent directory with global variables for all the MailChimp info you will need
to form the custom MailChimp URL.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `node server.js`

Runs the Express NodeJS webapplication that handles sending emails from the contact form.
You will need to create an Ethereal email and enter the correct details in "user" and
"pass" to be able to have the contact form work for you.

This must be run parallel to the website for the contact form to work.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Deployment

This website is deployed using firebase. This public repository doesn't have the necessary access to
deploy. But if you set up your own firebase hosting service, you can use:

`npm run build`

To create a build ready for deployment.

`firebase deploy --only hosting`

To deploy the frontend website.

`firebase deploy --only functions`

To deploy the backend email service.

### `npm run build` fails to minify
